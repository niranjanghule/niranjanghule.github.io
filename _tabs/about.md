Hi! My name is Niranjan Ghule. I'm a software engineer for almost 10 years now. I like working in Java programming language.
I started this blog to share my knowledge with you in a fun way. 

As an software engineer, you have to continously learn new technologies.
It would be extremely helpful if this new technologies can be explained in a way which could be understood easily.


The purpose of this blog is to help you in understanding Java related concepts in easy and fun way.
